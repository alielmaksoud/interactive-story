# Being Erica 
<p>As humans, we all have regrets. In some way or another we’ve been through situations or experiences where we wish to go back time and fix things, respond differently, or behave in a certain way. Erica is human too and as everyone she has a list of millions, maybe trillions of regrets.</p>

# Moral Story 
<p>one must learn to be who they are and learn to resign with good grace what they are not!
Regret is a nature that we can’t overcome but we still can embrace and learn from with a hope for better experiences.</p>
